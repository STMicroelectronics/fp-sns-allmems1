# ALLMEMS1 Application Description for STM32F446RE with X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 expansion board

The ALLMEMS1 is an STM32 ODE function pack which lets you connect your IoT node to a smartphone via BLEand use a suitable AndroidT or iOST like the ST BLE Sensor app (Version 4.13.0 or higher),
you can visualize real-time environmental sensor data, motion sensor data and digital microphone levels.
The package also allows to perform advanced functionality such as voice communication over BLE, sound source localization and acoustic beam forming using inputs from multiple microphones, well sensor data fusion and accelerometer-based real-time activity recognition. 

This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package
and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:
 - STEVAL-BCNKT01V1 (BlueCoin) evaluation board that contains the following components:
   - MEMS sensor devices: LPS22HB, LSM303AGR, LSM6DSM
   - digital microphone: 4 x MP34DT04-C1
 - The MotionFX (iNEMOEngine PRO) suite uses advanced algorithms to integrate outputs
   from multiple MEMS sensors in a smartway, independent of environmental conditions,
   to reach optimal performance. Real-time motion-sensor data fusion is set to significantly
   improve the user experience, increasing accuracy, resolution, stability and response time.
 - MotionAR (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides real-time activity recognition data 
   using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - AcousticSL software provides real-time audio source localization using PCM signal audio
 - AcousticBF software provides real-time beam forming software, using the audio signals acquired from two digital MEMS microphones,
   it creates a virtual directional microphone pointing to a fixed direction in space
 - BlueVoiceADPCM software enables real-time half-duplex voice-over-Bluetooth low energy communication profile.
   It includes one characteristic for audio transmission and one for synchronization and it is responsible for audio encoding and periodical data
   transmission on Server side and for decoding of received voice data on Client side
 
The Example application initizializes all the Components and Library creating 3 Custom Bluetooth services:
 - The first service exposes all the HW and SW characteristics:
   - HW characteristics related to MEMS sensor devices: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Magnetometer, Gyroscope and Accelleromenter,
     Microphones Signal Noise dB level and battery charge level. 
   - SW characteristics: the quaternions generated by the MotionFX library in short precision, the activity
     recognized using the MotionAR algorithm, the audio source localization using the AcousticSL software that provides real-time audio
	 source localization, AcousticBF software provides real-time beam forming
	 using the audio signals acquired from two digital MEMS microphones.
	 It uses BlueVoiceADPCM software for real-time half-duplex voice-over-Bluetooth low energy communication profile.
 - The second Service exposes the console services where we have stdin/stdout and stderr capabilities
 - The last Service is used for configuration purpose

This example must be used with the related ST BLE Sensor Android (Version 4.13.0 or higher) or iOS (Version 4.11.0 or higher) application available on Play/itune store,
in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

## Very Important

a) The implementation allow the Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA).
 
 1) The Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) is done using the ST BLE Sensor Android/iOS application (Version 4.13.0 and above)
 
 2) This example must run starting at address 0x08004000 in memory and works ONLY if the BootLoader 
    is saved at the beginning of the FLASH (address 0x08000000)
 
 3) For each IDE (IAR/µVision/STM32CubeIDE) there are some scripts *.bat/*.sh that makes the following operations:
    - Full Flash Erase
    - Load the BootLoader on the rigth flash region
    - Load the Program (after the compilation) on the rigth flash region (This could be used for a FOTA)
    - Dump back one single binary that contain BootLoader+Program that could be 
      flashed at the flash beginning (address 0x08000000) (This COULD BE NOT used for FOTA)
    - Reset the board
	
b) If the user presses the blue user button on Nucleo board 3 times on less that 2 seconds, he forces a new
   Calibration for MotionFX Library (For avoiding accidental erasure of the calibration data).
   The calibration value could be stored on FLASH memory or in RAM for avoiding to do the calibration at each board reset

## Dependencies

STM32Cube packages:
  - STM32F4xx drivers from STM32CubeF4 V1.26.2
  
X-CUBE packages:
  - X-CUBE-BLE1 V6.2.2
  - X-CUBE-MEMS1 V9.1.0
@par STSW packages:
  - STSW-BCNKT01 V2.1.3

## Hardware and Software environment

- This example runs on STEVAL-BCNKT01V1 (BlueCoin) evaluation board device and development board.
- This example must be used with the related ST BLE Sensor Android/iOS application available on Play/itune store, in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol
- Inside the Binary Directory there are the following binaries:
  - STM32F446ME-BlueCoin_ALLMEMS1_v4.2.0.bin     (Program without BootLoader. COULD BE USED     for FOTA)
  - STM32F446ME-BlueCoin_ALLMEMS1_v4.2.0_BL.bin  (Program with BootLoader.    COULD NOT BE USED for FOTA)

## How to use it ?

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz. IAR, Keil µVision 5 and Integrated Development Environment for STM32. 
In order to make the  program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\Project.eww
 - Rebuild all files and run these script that you find on the same directory:
   - CleanALLMEMS1_IAR_BC.bat

For Keil µVision 5:
 - Open Keil µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.32.0).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\STM32F446ME-BlueCoin_ALLMEMS1.uvprojx
 - Rebuild all files and run these script that you find on the same directory:
   - CleanALLMEMS1_MDK_ARM_BC.bat
 
For Integrated Development Environment for STM32:
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.8.0).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the System
   Workbench project is located (it should be STM32CubeIDE). 
 - Rebuild all files and and run these script that you find on the same directory:
   - if you are on windows and you had installed the STM32 ST-Link utility:
	 - CleanALLMEMS1_STM32CubeIDE_BC.bat
   - Otherwise (Linux/iOS or Windows without the STM32 ST-Link Utility):
	 - CleanALLMEMS1_STM32CubeIDE_BC.sh
