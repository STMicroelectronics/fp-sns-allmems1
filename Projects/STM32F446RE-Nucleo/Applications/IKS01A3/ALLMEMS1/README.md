## <b>ALLMEMS1 Application Description</b>

Application for STM32F446RE with X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1, X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 expansion boards.

Example Description:

The ALLMEMS1 is an STM32 ODE function pack which lets you connect your IoT node to a smartphone via BLE and use a suitable AndroidT or iOST like the ST BLE Sensor app,
you can visualize real-time environmental sensor data, motion sensor data and digital microphone levels.
The package also allows to perform advanced functionality such as sound source localization using inputs from multiple microphones, as well sensor data fusion and accelerometer-based real-time activity recognition. 

The Example application initizializes all the Components and Library creating 3 Custom Bluetooth services:

 - The first service exposes all the HW and SW characteristics:
   - the HW characteristics related to MEMS sensor devices: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Magnetometer, Gyroscope and Accelleromenter
     and Microphones Signal Noise dB level. 
   - the SW characteristic: the quaternions generated by the MotionFX library in short precision,
     the activity recognized using the MotionAR algorithm, the audio source localization using the AcousticSL software that provides real-time audio
	 source localization.
 - The second Service exposes the console services where we have stdin/stdout and stderr capabilities
 - The last Service is used for configuration purpose

The example application allows the user to control the initialization phase via UART.
Launch a terminal application and set the UART port to 115200 bps, 8 bit, No Parity, 1 stop bit.

This example must be used with the related ST BLE Sensor Android (Version 4.20.0 or higher) or iOS (Version 4.20.0 or higher) application available on Play/itune store,
in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

### <b>Important Hardware Additional Information</b>

1) For F4xx STM32 Nucleo motherboard, there is an hardware conflict between the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 expansion board and the X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2
   expansion board through the Arduino UNO R3 extension connector.
   The hardware conflict is onto 5,6 and 7 pin of the CN9 arduido connector.
   For X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3:
   - In the pin 5 (SB27) and 6 (SB26) there are the interrupts INT1 and INT2 for LSM6DSL component (used for the feature hardware)
   - In the pin 7 (SB25) there is the interrupt for LPS22HB component
   For X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2:
   - In the pin 5 (SB7)  there is the clock for the Microphones
   - In the pin 6 (SB15) there is the clock x2 for the Microphones
   - In the pin 7 (SB17) there is the connection for the microphone PDM34 (solder bridge open as default)
   
   For this reason the hardware features are not available for F4xx STM32 Nucleo motherboard (The related gpio pins is not configured).
   
2) BlueNRG-2 library does not work with the stock firmware that is loaded in the BLE module of X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1 expansion board.
   For this reason:
   - first of all, it is needed to solder on X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1, if it is not soldered, a 0 Ohm resistor at R117
   - then you can use a standard ST-Link V2-1 with 5 jumper wires female-female together with STSW-BNRGFLASHER software tool
    (currently available only for Windows PC) in order to update the firmware of the BLE module of X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1.
   
   Read user manual for more details.
   
### <b>Very Important</b> 

a) The implementation allow the Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA).
 
 1) The Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) is done using the ST BLE Sensor Android/iOS application (Version 4.20.0 and above)
 
 2) This example must run starting at address 0x08004000 in memory and works ONLY if the BootLoader 
 is saved at the beginning of the FLASH (address 0x08000000)
 
 3) In the folder Utilities there is a scripts *.sh that makes the following operations:
    - Full Flash Erase
    - Load the BootLoader on the rigth flash region
    - Load the Program (after the compilation) on the rigth flash region (This could be used for a FOTA)
    - Dump back one single binary that contain BootLoader+Program that could be 
      flashed at the flash beginning (address 0x08000000) (This COULD BE NOT used for FOTA)
    - Reset the board
	
	Before to execute the *.sh script, it is necessary to edit it to set the installation path for STM32CubeProgrammer.
	
	BootLoaderPath/<BootLoader file name> and BinaryPath as input are required when execute *.sh script
	
b) If the user presses the blue user button on Nucleo board 3 times on less that 2 seconds, he forces a new
   Calibration for MotionFX Library (For avoiding accidental erasure of the calibration data).
   The calibration value could be stored on FLASH memory or in RAM for avoiding to do the calibration at each board reset
